# house_prices_intelligible_regression

The project aims to produce intelligible regression results for a house price dataset. First we examine the dataset with KDE and correlation plots. Subsequently we set up a classic linear regression model. We visualize the regression results and examine the feature importance using shap values and produce a model prediction for a single data observation.
